This program main function is to remove spaces and dashes from a Navori product key.
########################################
At my job we use Navori to provide content to devices such as small form factor computers (NUC and similar style computers), and SOC displays.
My company typcially use Samsung QM modes to stream digital sigange from Navori
Depending on the firmware version of the SOC display, when entering the Navori Key. Curtain characters or additional characters will be added which will cause the enrollment of the screen to fail.

This program is to remove the spaces and the dash from the product key. the Samsung SOC will add in those characters automatically.
